When hacking on open-isns, or when trying to locate a problem,
the following information may be useful:

 -	You can start the daemon using the -f option, which
 	prevents it from backgrounding itself. Crucial if
	you want to run it in a debugger, or under strace.

	This option works for isnsd and isnsdd

 -	All tools support the "-d" option to enable debugging.
 	In general, you want to use "-d all" to turn on all
	debugging options. However, you can select individual
	debug facilities - check out the manpages and/or
	the source code in logging.c

 -	If isnsd crashes, and you suspect memory corruption,
	you can compile open-isns with memory debugging enabled.  Re-run
	the configure script and add the option --enable-memdebug. Then
	run "make clean all" to rebuild everything.

	Memory debugging can be chosen at run-time by setting the
	ISNS_MDEBUG environment variable, and re-starting the application:

	export ISNS_MDEBUG=1
	./isnsd -f -d all

	Memory debugging works for all memory allocations done by the
	Open-iSNS code, but does not affect memory allocations by other
	libraries (such as glibc or openssl).
